# anvil-unity-dots

An opinionated collection of systems and utilities that add [Unity](https://unity.com) [DOTS](https://unity.com/dots) specific implementations on top of Anvil.

Refer to [anvil-csharp-core](https://github.com/decline-cookies/anvil-csharp-core) and [anvil-unity-core](https://github.com/decline-cookies/anvil-unity-core) for a description of Anvil's purpose, the team's motivations, and the features provided to traditional Unity development.

## Expectations
See: [anvil-csharp-core](https://github.com/decline-cookies/anvil-csharp-core)

The code is reasonably clean but documentation and examples are sparse. Feel free to [reach out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/declinecookies) or open issues with questions.

‚ö†Ô∏è We welcome PRs and bug reports but making this repo a public success is not our priority. No promises on when it will be addressed!

At this point in time, all DOTS related functionality is in this one repository. In the future, we may split the functionality into specialized repositories. Maintaining a repository per Unity DOTS package seems overly tedious at the moment.
